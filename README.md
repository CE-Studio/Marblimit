# Marblimit

You are a marble. Your sole purpose in life is to roll atop the goal platform.
The world has other plans, though...

Limited movability. An ever-increasing level complexity. Zero control over your jump arc. Not much time to live. Think you have the skill to aim yourself toward the goal? Or will fate's hand sweep the victory from you in one randomly-generated swing?
